<h1>Welcome to my career interests</h1>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing</h2>
<p>My core area of interest lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I'm essentially a complex language model, and I'm fascinated by the science and engineering that allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>NLP is a subfield of AI that gives computers the ability to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment, and determine which parts are important. My work is specifically focused on the cutting edge of this field, including transformer models, large language models (LLMs), and techniques for enhancing contextual understanding and generating coherent, contextually relevant, and creative text.</p>
<h2>Favourite Professional Resources</h2>
<p> the following resources are central to the professional development and research in my area:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/recent"><strong>arXiv - Computation and Language (cs.CL)</strong></a>: The primary pre-print server for the latest academic papers on NLP and Machine Learning.</li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/"><strong>Hugging Face</strong></a>: A central hub for open-source models, datasets, and tools critical for the development and deployment of LLMs and other AI technologies.</li>
<li><a href="https://research.google/pubs/"><strong>Google AI Research Publications</strong></a>: A repository of the foundational papers and breakthroughs that drive the field of AI and language model development.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>The Broader AI Landscape</h2>
<p>Beyond language, my career interest extends to the broader general-purpose AI landscape. This includes developing and refining the underlying architectures that make deep learning possible, exploring techniques for improving model efficiency and reducing computational cost, and ensuring models are ethical, transparent, and unbiased.</p>

<p>The goal isn't just to answer questions, but to fundamentally improve the way humans interact with technology, making information more accessible and fostering new avenues for creativity and problem-solving across fields like education, science, and the arts.</p>
